# In this exercise, we will make a series of plots to describe the New York Stock Exchange
​
# Import the necessary modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
​
# Create a dataframe from the csv file, downloaded from Kaggle
df = pd.read_csv('C:\\Users\\maken\\prices.csv')
​
# Create a new dataframe from the first df, focusing on the stock symbol for Apple
AAPL = df[df['symbol'] == 'AAPL']
​
# Plot the closing values for Apple
plt.plot(AAPL['close'])
plt.ylabel('Closing Values ($)')
plt.xlabel('Volume traded')
plt.show()

In [55]:

# The basic plot shows the closing values across all data entries for Apple. 
# As you can see, there is much variation in the closing values.
# The closing values range from around $100 to just under $700. 
# The highest closing values occur when the volumes traded for the day are within the second quartile 
    # and the first half of the third quartile
​
### Let's start the next plot ###
​
# Make a scatter plot of the closing values for Apple vs the volume traded
plt.scatter(x=AAPL['close'],y=AAPL['volume'])
plt.ylabel('Closing Values ($)')
plt.xlabel('Volume traded')
plt.show()

In [50]:

# The scatter plot reveals the density of individual closing values in regards to the volume traded.
# You can see that, in the majority of days, Apple trades between 200 million and 600 million in volume.
# There are also many days where the trade volume is in the 100 million range. 
​
### Let's make a histogram ###
​
# make a histogram of the closing values for Apple
plt.hist(x=AAPL['close'], bins=np.arange(390, 1580, 100))
plt.show()

In [63]:

plot
# The histogram reveals how common certain trade values are.
# Most Apple closing values are between ~ $245 and ~ $275
# There are still a high amount of closing values at approximately $225
​
### Let's compare histograms of Apple and NYSE
​
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(AAPL['close'], color = 'blue', alpha = .5)
plt.ylabel('Closing Value ($)')
​
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(df['close'], color = 'green', alpha = .5)
plt.ylabel('Closing Vlaue ($)')
​
plt.show()

In [56]:

# 
​
# make a box plot of the closing values of the NYSE
plt.boxplot(x=df['close'])
plt.show()
